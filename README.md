In electrical and electronic systems, capacitors and inductors are two fundamental passive components used to store energy. A capacitor stores energy in the electric field, while an inductor stores energy in the magnetic field.

The concept of energy density (energy stored per unit volume) helps engineers understand how efficiently a device can store energy and how small or large it needs to be for practical applications.

Understanding the energy density of capacitors and inductors is crucial in power electronics, communication systems, filters, renewable energy converters, and many core-industry ECE applications.
## 2. Energy Density of a Capacitor
A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by a dielectric material.

Energy Density

Energy density is energy per unit volume:

Substituting gives:

Meaning
1. Energy density increases if the electric field increases.
2. Higher permittivity (ε) materials can store more energy.
3. The limit is dielectric breakdown (maximum electric field before failure).
