## EMT & TL--SA-II
## Energy density of capacitor and inductor
## 1. Introduction
Define what energy density means (in general: energy per unit volume)
Why it matters in electrical/electronic systems (capacitors and inductors store energy)
State that this assignment will derive the expressions for energy density in a capacitor and inductor, compare them, and show practical significance in ECE core industry devices.
